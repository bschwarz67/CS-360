this lab is a continuation of lab 5, which condenses a summary of a directory and its subdirectories/files into a single .tarc file. This lab was to write a program that recreates the directory
from the tarc file. Maybe the most straightforward lab in the course, but some small bugs such as my lack of precision with C IO libraries cost me a ton of time. 
That's what I get for skipping over this lab and coming back to it at the end.

compile: make
run/grade: ./gradescript (1-100) or ./gradeall or ./bin/tarx < {x}.tarc if you just want to test the bin on a file you happen to have.

Quirks: I read/write fixed sizes because I am assuming the .tarc file is being created and unpacked on my machine, where those are the correct sizes of the data types. As in the lab 5, I 
took the part of the gradescript that limits the number of open files out because I didnt want to bother with configuring it on my machine. I promise I close my files after I write to them,
shouldn't be an issue.
